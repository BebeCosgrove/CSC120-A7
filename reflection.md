Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For Cafe.java, I overloaded the sellCoffee because I wanted to add nCups as an input in case someone bought multiple cups of coffee at the same time. I also overloaded the constructor to just have name, address, and nfloors as inputs so i could have a set amount of coffee, sugar packets, creams, and cups that the cafe always has. 

For Library.java, I overloaded two constructors: one with both the elevator and number of floors as false and 1 as default values and another constructor with just false as the default for elevator because I wanted there to be a constructor that assumed that if there wasn't an input for those two things, then it was assumed that there was only one floor in the building and that there was no elevator.

For House.java, I overloaded two constructors: one with both hasDiningRoom and eleavtor set to false by default and then the other having only elevator set to false. I did this because I wanted to assume that if there was no hasDiningRoom or elevator inputted,  then it was assumed that their values were false.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Once I understood how to overload the constructors it was pretty simple so I'd recommend spending a good amount of time tryng to understand that for other people who take this class. in the future
